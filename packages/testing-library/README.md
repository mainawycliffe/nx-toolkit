# The Testing Library Setup For NX

If you want to setup testing library for NX, this is the place to start.

## What is Testing Library?

[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) is simple and complete testing
utilities that encourage good testing practices. It is available for React, Vue,
Angular, and major frameworks.

## What is NX?

[NX](https://nx.dev/) is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.

## Why Testing Library Setup for NX?

NX is a great tool for managing monorepos. This means, unlike a normal single
app repository approach, you can have multiple apps and libraries in a single
repo. And set up testing library for each app and library can be a tedious
and repetitive task. This setup will help you to setup testing library, complete
with all required dependencies and helpers, for your NX apps and libraries.
